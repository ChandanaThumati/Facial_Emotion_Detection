While Disney uses emotion-detection tech to find out opinion on a completed project, other brands have used it to directly inform advertising and digital marketing.

Kellogg's is just one high-profile example, having used Affectiva's software to test audience reaction to ads for its cereal.

Unilever does this, using HireVue's Al-powered technology to screen prospective candidates based on factors like body language and mood. In doing so, the company is able to find the person whose personality and characteristics are best suited to the job.

we will build a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture and train the model on [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) dataset for Emotion recognition from images.
